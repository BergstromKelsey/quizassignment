Coding Quiz Assignment

This project provides user with a game to play, specifically a quiz on States & their capitals. The user is timed during the quiz, and if the user answers a question incorrectly, 10 seconds is shaved off the timer. At the end of the quiz, the user is given their score, high score and also is asked to submit their initals for keeping in the local storage on their computer.

This project was challening, but I do feel like things are starting to click, I am understanding a lot, the more I code the more I understand things. I did have a light bulb moment on Javascript pages, and that they can only link to one HTML page, unless its the exact same things happening (duh)! 
To use this program simply load the page, click start and take the quiz!
